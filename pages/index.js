            Hi there!
            <br />
            I am a Frontend Developer with a couple of years of experience, passionate about creating intuitive and efficient user interfaces using React.
            <br />
            I have hands-on experience in building interactive components, implementing state management, and integrating APIs with the application. I am also proficient in working with React hooks and functional components, which help me write clean and reusable code.
            <br />
            Apart from technical skills, I believe in being a team player and have actively contributed to the success of the projects I have worked on. I am comfortable working in an agile environment and have experience in collaborating with designers and other developers to deliver high-quality code.
            <br />
            I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest developments in the React ecosystem. I am currently exploring the use of Next.js, GraphQL and other front-end frameworks to enhance my skills further.
            <br />
            I am a highly motivated React Developer, ready to take on new challenges and contribute to building innovative and user-friendly applications.
